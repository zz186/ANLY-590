Assignment 

1 Regularization.

Using the accompanying Hitters dataset (found here), we will explore regression models to predict a player's Salary from other variables. You can use any programming languages or frameworks that you wish.

1.1 Use LASSO regression to predict Salary from the other numeric predictors (you should omit the categorical predictors). 
1.1.1. Create a visualization of the coefficient trajectories
1.1.2. Comment on which are the final three predictors that remain in the model
1.1.3. Use cross-validation to find the optimal value of the regularization penalty
1.1.4. How many predictors are left in that model?

1.2 Repeat with Ridge Regression. 
1.2.1 Visualize the coefficient trajectories
1.2.2 Use cross-validation to find the optimal value of the regularization penalty

2 Short Answer. 
2.1 Explain in your own words the bias-variance tradeoff
2.2 What role does regularization play in this tradeoff? 
2.3 Make reference to your findings in number (1) to describe models of high/low bias and variance
